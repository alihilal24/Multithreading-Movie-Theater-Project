# Multithreading Movie Theater Project
To execute the code, the command is ```java P2Main.java "name of movie list text file"```
this will complie and excecute the code.

The text file of the movies list should be in the same directory as the source code.

This project represents my exploration of multithreading concepts. 
I delved into the realms of concurrency versus parallelism, various thread states, and the intricacies of thread synchronization. 
Simultaneously, I crafted a movie theater simulator that emulates tasks like managing the movie ticket counter, overseeing the snack bar, and simulating the passage of time during movie screenings.
